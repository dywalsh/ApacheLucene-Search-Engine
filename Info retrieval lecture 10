Stop Word Removal

Remove words that are poor descriptors
	=connectives 
	-articles
	-prepositions

	-reduce number of index terms


	can also include:
		verbs, adverbs, adj
		some numbers and dates
	These words add no decriptive value to the index

	Possible problem:
		-"to be or not to be"

	Feature normalisation:
		words need to appear in diff forms
		reduce words to stems (common concepts) : walking -> walk
		remove suffixes -ed -s -er...


	Stemming is used to conflate morphologically similar terms
		-walking, walker, walks -> walk
		-improve retrieval effectiveness
		-reduce Index size

	A typical stemmer consists of a collection of rules/or dictionaries
		-Porter2 (widely considered overall the best), not the fastest,most accurate etc
		-snowball

	problems:
		stems that are not words
		errors can occur:
			missed connections: european - europe
			false connections: universe - university - universal ( considered the same )
			wont recognise proper nouns: Thomas -> Thoma

		Porter2 exception clause:
			e.g news is not a stem of new

		Retreival performance: 
			for search 'walk' must return IOs for 'walking','walks'


	Phrases:
		phrases are clearly important in IR
		many of 2 or 3 word queries submitted to search engines are phrases.
		given the query "climbing equipment"
			-should we only retrieve documents all contain the exact phrase
			-should docs get credit for containing the words "climb","climbing", and equipment
		-determined by retrieval model used

		There are a number of possible definitions of a phrase
			-simple noun phrase used most freq
			-sequences of nouns, or adj followed by nouns.

		part of speech(POS) tagger used to label words.
			-stat and rule based approaches trained using large corpus manually trained. -> to then use on unseen content in the future
