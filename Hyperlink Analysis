Hyperlink Analysis

Link Analysis

	Help web search engines understand the relationships between pages
		-linking page and linked to page (need to look at both)

	Give an indication of website popularity (dont know why, but know it is popular) - is always exceptions e.g bad content or article containing links to worst websites etc.
	Detected relationships help rank web pages more effectively
	Many of the concepts were adapted from the concept of citation analysis in academia.

	Anchor Text
		<a href ="url"> Anchor Text </a>

		Has consistently been one of the strongest(if not THE STRONGEST) signals in web search
			-tends to be short (average two or three words)
				-those words often succintly describe the topic of the linked page.
			-Queries are often very similar to anchor text
				-short topical descriptions of a sought for web apage.
		All anchor text in 

		Almost always written by people who are not the authors of the dest page
			-describes the linked page from an independent, or diff perspective.
			-tends to emphasise the most important aspect of the page from a the perspective of "the crowd".
		TREC Evaluations have shown that is it most

	Popularity and Relevance

		Trillions of web pages
			-Many are spam or contain no useful content at all
			-Others are personal blogs, wedding announcements, family pics, fan fiction etc.
				-Interesting to small audience.
			-small proportion are popular and useful to many
				-netflix, fb, twitter, spotify etc.

			Link analysis can give a strong isgnal to search engines to estimate popularity and relevance.
			Simplest Approach
				-count the num of inlinks for each page.
				-use this count to influence ranking algo
				-susceptible to spam.

		Hyperlink Algorithms
			-dont treat each link the same -> links from popular sites more important than others.

			Recursive algo which assume...
				-quality of page is directly related to the quality of the pages that link to it.
				-popularity of a page is indicated by the number of pages that link to it.
				-popular pages are more likely to contain relevant information than unpopular pages.
			Link measures are generated for each page and used in ranking.

		Hubs and Authorities ( first main assumption on this )
			-assumption
				-if a link exists from page a -> page b
					-author of a recommends B
				-A page that is linked to by many influential pages in a subject area is an authority.
				-A page that links to many influential pages in a subject area is a hub
				(can have both a hub and authority score -> both could be high hence indicating that it is both hub and authority.)

			Hub ranking is ranked based on the incoming links to it.
			If a hub links to another site(authority) the influence level is passed on to the authority from the hub.



		HITS algorithm
			Hyperlink induced topic selection - HITS
				-popular pages can become hubs or authorities.
				-quality of each hub and authority is calc based






				-
			Performs a series of iterations consisting of 2 steps.
				-authority update
					-update each nodes authority score to be equal to the sum of the hub scores of each node that points to it. (the authority is only as important as the hubs that point to it)


				-hub update
					-update each nodes hub score to be equal to the sum of authoritys scores that each nodes point to it.

			Start with each node having a hub score and authority score of 1.
				-run the authority update rule
				-run the hub update rule
				-normalize values
					-dividing each hub score by square root of the sum of the squres of all hub scores
					-dividing each authority score by the square root of the sum of the squres of all authority scores.
				-repeat from second step.
